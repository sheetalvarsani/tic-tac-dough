# Tic Tac Dough

<br>

## Game Overview

**Tic Tac Dough** is a digital version of the classic game Tic-Tac-Toe. In this carb-themed version, two players take turns to place their symbols on a 3x3 grid. Instead of the traditional "X" and "O," players use images of a **Bagel** and a **Baguette** as their symbols.  

The objective of the game is to be the first to get three of your symbols in a row, column, or diagonal. The game ends when a player wins or all the cells are filled, resulting in a draw.
